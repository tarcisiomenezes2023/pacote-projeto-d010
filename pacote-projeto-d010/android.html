            <h1>Android Mascot History</h1>

            <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android operating system</strong>, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most widely used for mobile devices worldwide. But maybe you don't know that your friendly mascot has a name and a very curious story? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>

            <h2>The first version</h2>

           <p>The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" class="externo">Dan Morrill</a>. He says he opened <a href="https://www.nchsoftware.com/drawpad/index.html?kw=inkscape&msclkid=096bae6c67e51257ba9fcb2baa694115&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=EN-C2&utm_term=inkscape&utm_content=DrawPad%20-%20Competitors%20-%20Graphics" target="_blank" class="externo">Inkscape</a> (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was just to personify the system only for your team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            <p>This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: it would be the Dandroids.</p>
            
            <h2>A new pet appears</h2>

            <p>The idea of having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank" class="externo">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a more enjoyable way.</p>

                <img src="imagens/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Irina Blok, a criadora do Bugdroid">
            </picture>

            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The drawing should also generate quick identification with those who look at it. Then came Bugdroid, Android's new mascot.</p>
            
            <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" class="pequena" alt="Bugdroid">

            <p>The main inspiration for the new <strong>Bugdroid's</strong> features came from those little dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the Google office and looked at the side of the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.</p>

            <p>Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a candy, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to version 9.0.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, <strong>Android Q</strong> didn't exist, as Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using numbering, which gave rise to Android 10.</p>
